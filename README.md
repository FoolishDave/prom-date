## What is Prom Date?
Prom Date is a modloader for the game Monster Prom which allows creators to implement custom events with little to no programming experience. Depending on how complex the desired mod, it's very possible no code is required at all. 

## What can Prom Date do?
In it's current state, Prom Date is capable of reading XML files, turning them into in-game events, items, endings, and characters. You can add in additional randomly triggered events or entire new storylines.

## So I can finally date [Slayer/Narrator/Myself?]
Sure, add some events where you date the sun for all I care.

## Where can I download this???
Prom Date is not officially released as of yet. You can download and compile this yourself if you truly desire, or download the installer from the releases page, but don't come crying to me when your game crashes or weird things happen. You've been warned.

## Can I see some examples?
