## What is Prom Date?
Prom Date is a "modloader" for the multiplayer dating simulator Monster Prom. The current focus for Prom Date is to allow for somewhat easy creation of new events. That's the reason for the quotes, it technically "loads mods" in the form of new events from xml files, but not traditional mods which actually add new code. We'll see if there's need for that as development goes on.

## What can Prom Date do?
In it's current state, Prom Date is capable of reading XML files, turning them into in-game events, and adding them to the existing pool of events in the game. This means you can add new standard class events, lunchroom events, special continuous events, and even endings.

## So I can finally date [Slayer/Narrator/Myself?]
Sure, add an event where you date the sun for all I care.

## Can I see an example?
